## Dataset

The Ameo AMCAT 2015 dataset is a comprehensive collection of assessment results from job applicants conducted using the AMCAT assessment tool. It includes various parameters related to candidates' academic background, technical skills, cognitive abilities, and other demographic information. This anonymized dataset contains valuable insights for research and analysis in the field of recruitment and talent acquisition.

The dataset is available for download at [https://example.com/dataset](https://example.com/dataset).

## Project Goals

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform an in-depth exploration of the dataset to understand its structure, distribution, and relationships between variables.

2. Data Preprocessing: Cleanse the data, handle missing values, and prepare it for analysis.

3. Statistical Analysis: Conduct various statistical tests to uncover patterns, correlations, and associations within the data.

4. Predictive Modeling: Build predictive models to forecast job performance and assess candidate suitability.

5. Visualization: Create meaningful visual representations to communicate insights effectively.

## Methods

The project will utilize the following tools and libraries:

- Python: For data cleaning, analysis, and modeling.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- NumPy: For numerical computations.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
- SciPy: For statistical tests and analysis.
- Scikit-learn: For machine learning modeling and evaluation.

## Results

The results and findings of this project will be documented in a report and presented visually through graphs and charts. The report will be made available in the repository as well.
